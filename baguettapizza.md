# Ingredients

* 1 French baguette
* 1/2 cup pizza sauce, or as needed
* 2/3 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 2 ounces cooked and crumbled sausage
* 2 ounces mini pepperoni slices

# Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
* Split baguette in half lengthwise. Warm pizza sauce in a microwave-safe bowl until hot, about  45 seconds.
* Spread pizza sauce on baguette, sprinkle on cheese, and scatter sausage and pepperoni on top as desired. Place pizza onto a baking tray.
* Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 18 minutes. Optional step: turn on the oven’s broiler, set a rack 6 inches below the heating element, and broil the pizza for a deeper color, 1 to 2 minutes.
* Cut pizza crosswise into slices. Serve and enjoy.
